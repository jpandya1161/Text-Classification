# Text-Classification
Here we are given a Text dataset which contains Ham and Spam emails. Now we must make different classifier models to evaluate that on getting a new dataset, machine should be able to decide if that email is ham or spam. Also, we are comparing evaluation metrics for different models for the same problem, given different new datasets.
